Planto is a beautifully designed SwiftUI app that helps users keep their plants happy and healthy by tracking watering schedules, sunlight exposure, and plant locations all in one place. The app makes plant care easier by reminding users when to water and take care of their plants, offering a calm dark-themed interface that fits naturally with iOS. Many plant owners forget to water or monitor their plants regularly, and Planto solves this by sending reminders, keeping all plants organized in one view, and tracking sun exposure and water amounts. To get started, users simply open Planto, tap “Set Plant Reminder,” add their plants by entering names, locations, and care details, and start receiving reminders. 🌿
